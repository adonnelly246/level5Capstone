# level5Capstone
setup and outline for the level 5 capstone. My additions before merging with group project

Have you ever not been able to decide what video game to play next after completing all of the ones in your game library? Do all of your current games not spark interest anymore and your unsure what to play instead?
Or do you know what type of game you want to play, but aren't sure which one?

This web app can help you! It categorizes games and compiles a list based of your search criteria.
It also holds a list of games that you saved to look through later.

This repository uses a created API of video games to help the user find a game to play.
The games have 3 categories to sort them into, with room for more options to be added later.
Each game has a title, number of players, price, category, console, and rating property.

Front-end Features: searchbar, navigation, dropdown option menu(console,title,rating, price, category) to choose which search criteria to look through using the user's search terms, saved games page, home page, and current search page. 

The user will be able to navigate from the home page and view their saved search list on the 'Saved Games' page
This page organizes the games by the dropdown menu (players, price, rating, console, or category)
